    "- a high-level machine learning library for Python, that has well known algorithims built-in\n",

    "Tutorial Source:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: a learning problem considers a set of n samples of data and then tries to predict properties of unknown data. If each sample is more than a single number and, for instance, a multi-dimensional entry (aka multivariate data), it is said to have several attributes or features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Problem Categories:\n",
    "#### Supervised:\n",
    "##### Classification\n",
    "- a discrete (as opposed to continuous) form of supervised learning where one has a limited number of categories\n",
    "- Ex: digit recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Regression\n",
    "- used when data is continous. Ex: prediction of length of lizard based on its age and weight\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised:\n",
    "- goal in such problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data: clustering,\n",
    "- or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation\n",
    "- or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization \n",
    "\n",
    "### Training and Testing Set\n",
    "- the training set, on which we learn some properties; we call the other set the testing set, on which we test the learned properties.\n",

    "### Learning and Predicting\n",
    "For now, consider estimator as a black box.\n",
    "\n",
    "From wiki, (in stats) an estimator is a rule for calculating an estimate of a given quantity based on observed data: thus the rule (the estimator), the quantity of interest (the estimand) and its result (the estimate) are distinguished.\n",
